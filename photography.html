        <h3>How I Started Photography</h3>
         <h5 id="section1">Beginning</h5>
        <p>
            The interest came by when I was 15 year old .My dad had a camera of sony which i used to click photos.
            Even my family members where surprised seeing these photos.
            But,Unforunately the camera broke and was never repaired.

        <h5 id="section2">understanding My interest</h5>
        <p>
            Years later when I was 16 my parents brought me a phone honor 7a.
            Then the interest in camera rised up again .
            and I had captured some photos for my festival times.
        </p>

            after covid-19 waiting to buy a dslr.
