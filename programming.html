        <h3>How I Started Programming</h3>
        <h5 id="section1">Beginning</h5>
        <p>
            The first time i was intorduced to programming was when i joined for my senior secondary.
            I selected computer science for me because i was didn't like other courses.
            The first year as ok.
            In that year i understood the topics of my computer class faster than the other students in the class.
            At the end i  was teaching the whole boys in my class  because i was so interested in the subject that i had learned it early and taught my friendsand our teacher had to teach python which was new for her.
        </p>
        <h5 id="section2">understanding My interest</h5>
        <p>
            The second year was just insane because I student who is below average in his subject but was the topper in computer science the whole year.
            I helped many of my friends who knew nothing about python to above average students in class.Moreover I did 2 projects for practical.
            1 for the group i worked and other one for my group of friend.One was a game and Other was a database project which keep unique password of your platforms and show you when needed.
        </p>
        <h5 id="section3">The Present</h5>
        <p>
            At the present i am learning on your course and studying for my final computer science paper which was resheduled because of covid-19
